# RNNs TV Script Generation - Deep Learning!!

**Recurrent Neural Networks** -
*Basic Idea Behind Using RNNS for Generation Of TV Scripts* --- 

Humans don’t start their thinking from scratch every second. when we read any article, we understand each word based on our understanding of previous words. We don’t throw everything away and start thinking from scratch again. Our thoughts have persistence.
Traditional neural networks can’t do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming.
`Recurrent neural networks` address this issue. They are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist.
Under this project i have **LSTMs** -- a very special kind of recurrent neural network which works, for many tasks, much much better than the standard version of rnns.
**Long Short Term Memory networks** – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies
 **LSTMs** are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. 
 This Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in the training data.
 
 The principle of this model will be Text prediction: 
          Given some words, it will give us a list of possible words to put after. 
          To create this model, we use a dataset containing lines from Seinfeld TV scripts. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons and  I use it to generate a new scene.
 
 **THIS IS MY GENERATED SCRIPTS** -->
 
      jerry: he was just trying to get a little bit.
      kramer: yeah. well, it's not really a good idea for you.(jerry nods.)
      kramer: hey!
      jerry: hello?
      kramer: hey!
      george: hey!(kramer enters)
      george: i don't think so.
      george: oh!
      elaine:(to george) you know, i know what i am.
      george: oh.(pause) so, you think so?
      george: i don't know, i was in a very serious shower and i was in the restaurant with you.
      kramer: well, i think we can go out with you.
      jerry:(to jerry) hey.
      kramer: oh, you got the hell.
      george:(looking around) yeah, yeah.(he exits)
      george: what do you mean?
      jerry: you know, the whole thing is that.
      kramer: well, i was just curious.
      jerry: oh, yeah...
      jerry:(pointing) oh, i can't. i got a lot of money in my house, and he was in the middle of the aisle.
      kramer:(to elaine, she thinks) oh, hi.(jerry is shocked) oh, hi.
      george:(to kramer) what is this?
      george:(pointing around) well, if we had a good future for a woman, i mean, you know, the other one who has a problem?
      jerry:(smiling) well, you think i can have any idea, but i don't know. you know, i think we have to talk to her.
      elaine: oh, i got the money.
      jerry: you don't understand.
      kramer: oh!
      jerry:(to george) you know, i know, i don't know, i know.
      george: oh!
      kramer:(quietly) oh, hi, it's not my idea
